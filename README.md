This Python program allows users to schedule exams by performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a text-based menu. Users can add new exams, view scheduled ones, edit existing details, and delete exams.

Features Implemented:
1. Add a New Exam
-Users can input exam name, date, time, and room.
-The program saves this information in a list of dictionaries.

2. View All Exams
-Displays all saved exam schedules in a numbered list.
-Shows exam name, date, time, and room.

3. Edit an Exam Entry
-Lets the user pick which exam to update using its number.
-User can then modify any detail (name, date, time, or room).

4. Delete an Exam Entry
-Lets the user delete a specific exam by selecting its number.
-Removes the exam from the schedule list.

5. Looping Menu System
-After every action, the menu appears again.
-Program only ends when the user chooses Exit.


How It Works (Step-by-Step)
1. The program starts by defining an empty list called exams which stores all exam schedules.
2. A while loop is used to show the menu again and again until the user exits.
3. Depending on the userâ€™s input, the program performs one of the four main CRUD actions:

Option 1: Calls add_exam() function to collect details and save them.

Option 2: Calls view_exams() to display current data.

Option 3: Calls edit_exam() where the user can choose an exam and update its info.

Option 4: Calls delete_exam() to remove an entry.
Option 5: Exits the program.

4. Each CRUD function uses Python dictionaries to store structured data for every exam.
5. Input validation and clear prompts are used to make the program beginner-friendly and readable.
